# Human Posture Detection

In recent years, posture recognition has become a research hotspot in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI). It involves analyzing sensor or camera data through algorithms to extract information about human posture. Human posture detection has promising market potential in many fields such as behavior recognition, gait analysis, gaming, animation, augmented reality, rehabilitation, and sports science.

## Overview

This project implements a human posture detection system using deep learning models. The system captures live video input from cameras or sensor devices and analyzes it to detect various human postures. The key technology involves algorithms that can understand human skeletal structure and predict the posture based on joint positions.

Key features of the system include:
- Detection of key human body joints (e.g., shoulders, elbows, knees).
- Real-time posture tracking.
- Compatibility with pre-trained models like OpenPose, PoseNet, and MediaPipe.
- Customizable for specific applications such as healthcare, fitness, and rehabilitation.

## Installation

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/human-posture-detection.git
    cd human-posture-detection
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Make sure you have Python 3.x and OpenCV installed:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

4. Optionally, you can also install TensorFlow or PyTorch based on the model you're using:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow
    # or
    pip install torch
    ```

## Usage

1. To run the system, capture video using your webcam:
    ```bash
    python posture_detection.py
    ```

2. You can also pass in a pre-recorded video file:
    ```bash
    python posture_detection.py --video path_to_video.mp4
    ```

3. You can configure the model and settings in `config.py`:
    - Choose between different models (e.g., OpenPose, PoseNet, or a custom model).
    - Set thresholds for confidence scores.

4. Detected posture information will be displayed in real-time with visual markers on the key body joints.

## Dataset

We use publicly available datasets to train and evaluate our model:
- [COCO Keypoints Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#keypoints-2020): A dataset containing images with human pose annotations.
- [MPII Human Pose Dataset](http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/): A widely used dataset for human pose estimation.

Alternatively, you can use your own dataset by formatting the data to include the keypoints.

## Model

We use deep learning models for human posture detection, which can be based on:
- **OpenPose**: Detects human keypoints in real-time.
- **PoseNet**: Lightweight model for real-time human pose estimation.
- **MediaPipe**: A Google solution for cross-platform real-time perception.

You can experiment with these models by changing the configuration in `config.py`.

## Applications

Human posture detection can be applied to a wide range of fields, including:
- **Healthcare**: Monitoring patients' physical movements during rehabilitation.
- **Sports Science**: Analyzing athletes' postures to optimize performance.
- **Gaming & AR**: Enhancing player interactions in immersive environments.
- **Workplace Ergonomics**: Monitoring employees' posture to prevent musculoskeletal disorders.
